# C# Custom Editor Tools - Unity 5

Contains project files for Unity 5 Custom Editor Tools

	A simple C# project that allowed me to learn how to use Unity's custom editor to make tools for my new undisclosed VR project.
	I was intrigued by how easy Unity makes it to create your own buttons and editor scripts so I decide to look up some tutorials
	on how to make some useful Editor tools.
